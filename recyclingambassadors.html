        <h1>Recycling ambassadors are making real life changes around the world!</h1>

        <h3>Why become a recycling ambassador?</h3>

        <p>Several studies in April found that young people are more committed than other generations to mitigating the effects of single-use plastic, with 68% of 18 to 24-year-olds currently owning a reusable water bottle, above the national average of
            55%. There are recycling schemes that can be run in school/college which will help your institution become greener and help the environment. Can you start your own project and talk to your local authority to see what schemes they are running?</p>

        </p>

        <h3> What can I do as a Recycling Ambassador? </h3>

        <h4> School Recycling Schemes</h4>

        <p> There are almost 34,000 schools in the UK and they play a vital role in dealing with waste. Recycling schemes in schools help to improve the environment and can reduce money spent by the school on waste disposal.</p>
        ​
        <h4>Paper Recycling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper is the main form of waste created by schools, making up at least a quarter of all its rubbish.</li>
            <li>Contact your local council and ask them to provide your school with a paper-recycling bin.</li>
            <li>Set up a paper collection scheme for each classroom by making ‘paper only’ boxes for the children and teachers to put used paper in.</li>
            <li>Involve pupils by allowing them to create posters and bright labels for the recycle bins.</li>
            <li>Brief the teachers about the recycling scheme and hold assemblies to inform the pupils.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the teachers and staff understand the importance of recycling, and this should filter down to the pupils.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Metal Recycling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Metal recycling schemes are good for schools with vending machines.</li>
            <li>Contact your local council and ask them to provide your school with a recycling bin for cans.</li>
            <li>Place the bins next to the vending machines and make sure they are clearly labelled.</li>
            <li>Make sure that both teachers and pupils understand on the importance of recycling.</li>
            <li>Find out if there is a ‘cash for cans’ program running in your area.</li>
            <li>Buy recycled print cartridges whenever possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Composting Scheme</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact your local council who may be able to provide a compost bin for your school, in some cases, compost bins are provided free of charge.</li>
            <li>Your councils recycling officer will be able to advise you further.</li>
            <li>Teachers and children can be involved in making the compost by adding items such as tea bags, coffee granules, fruit and vegetable cuttings from the cafeteria.</li>
            <li>If your school has a garden, then you can add leaves, plant cuttings and grass trimmings to the compost heap.</li>
        </ul>
