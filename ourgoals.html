        <h2>Our goal is to empower young people to work together to save our planet!</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting our planet and reducing the consumption of natural resources in an irresponsible way.</p>
        <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
        <p>Running local recycling projects and sharing our ideas and achievements will help make a difference. Recycling matters highlights the current problems and provides a platform for recycling ambassadors to share their own global contributes with
            each other. Real people making a real difference!</p>
        <h2>Why recycle?</h2>
        <p>Recycling reduces the need for extracting (mining, quarrying and logging), refining and processing raw materials all of which create substantial air and water pollution. As recycling saves energy it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which
            helps to tackle climate change.<br>Further benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimises the amount of waste sent to landfill sites and incinerators</li>
            <li>Conserves the earth’s natural resources such as water, minerals, and wood</li>
            <li>Prevents pollution by reducing the need for new raw materials</li>
            <li>Supports manufacturing by conserving raw materials</li>
            <li>Helps create new jobs in recycling and manufacturing sectors across the globe</li>
            <li>Saves energy!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recycling facts for students:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>60% of waste that goes in the bin could be recycled.</li>
            <li>UK households use up to one tonne of waste per year on average, which weighs the equivalent of a small car!</li>
            <li>The average household dust bin per year, contains enough unrealised energy for 500 baths, 3500 showers or 5,000 hours of TV.</li>
            <li>The UK throws away approximately 455,000 tonnes of plastic bottles each year which is equivalent to around 9.1 billion bottles.</li>
            <li>It takes 95% less energy to recycle aluminium cans than it does to make new ones.</li>
            <li>Recycling one plastic bottle will save enough energy to light a 60w lightbulb for six hours.</li>
            <li>If every person were to recycle only 10% more paper every year, we would save approximately £5 million.</li>
