        <h2>How does recycling work?</h2>
        <img src="./images/cardboard.jpg">
        <p>
            The recycling bins are emptied out at ‘Material Recovery Facilities’ where advanced optical technology is used to view and sort the waste. A big drum tumbles the waste to separate all fine materials, such as soil and dust, and organics, such as food waste,
            which would contaminate recycled materials. This stuff gets filtered out and will be turned into a fuel product known as RDF. 2D material is separated from the 3D material. The 2D material goes on a belt under optics that recognize the different
            classes of material. Then, after a machine separates those materials, a worker sifts through them to make sure all the material is non-contaminated. Paper: Paper that is separated is sent off to go through a few processes to get turned back
            into usable paper. Your granola box from this morning may have been made out of recycled paper! Steel: The 3D material goes past a powerful magnet that removes all the ferrous (magnetic) metals. Steel picked up from the magnet is quite easy
            to reuse — it’s just crushed and melted down so it can be mixed with new steel and refashioned into new steel products. Glass: A fan pushes lighter goods such as aluminum (which isn’t magnetic) and plastic upward while heavier glass items
            drop down to a conveyor belt. The glass is crushed to no larger than 5 cm and sorted by color — clear, brown, and green. The colors are important because they’re permanent on glass. Clear glass is the easiest to make but the material held
            in the glass can degrade due to light exposure from the sun. Sam Adam’s founder was telling the truth when he said his bottles are brown to preserve the hoppy goodness of the beer. Aluminum: A big spinning drum called an Eddy Current Separator
            creates a strong magnetic field called an induction field that repels aluminum away while plastics continue on the conveyor belt. Like steel, aluminum can be fairly easily reused by shredding and melting it to make new sheets of aluminum.
            Plastics: All that’s left are plastics — but they’re made up of one of six different chemicals, which correspond to the numbers 1 through 6 you see on the bottom of bottles and containers (a #7 means it’s made from less popular chemicals).
            Some plastics are much easier to recycle than others. In newer recycling plants, infrared sensors separate the different types of plastics based on the different types of light they reflect. Some plastics are recycled but some, such as styrofoam,
            are thrown away because it doesn’t make financial sense to recycle them.

        <h2>What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
            Buy recycled paper and print on both sides. When using paper in the office, print on both sides of the sheet and recycle the paper when you are finished. By recycling one ton of paper, you can save 17 trees, almost 7,000 gallons of water and more than
            three cubic yards of landfill space. Recycle your outdated technology. According to EPA, Americans throw out two million tons of e-waste each year. Avoid adding to that waste by recycling your old technology. For more information on electronic
            recycling, visit http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/recycle/ecycling/donate.htm. Make recycling bins readily available. Make sure your home and office are outfitted with recycling bins for paper, plastic and metal. Keep them out in the open
            and label them appropriately. Sometimes the convenience factor is all that is needed. Recycle your empty ink and toner cartridges. Almost eight cartridges are thrown out in the United States every second of every day. That's almost 700,000
            cartridges per day. Buy remanufactured ink and toner cartridges. Each remanufactured cartridge keeps approximately 2.5 pounds of metal and plastic out of landfills and saves about a half gallon of oil. Recycle old newspapers laying around
            the office. When finished reading the newspaper, either leave it for someone else to read or recycle it. Look for the recycled option in all the products you buy. It's not just paper that is recycled. Buy rechargeable batteries. It takes 1,000
            regular batteries to equal the lifespan of one rechargeable battery. When you are discarding your batteries, recycle them. Purchase rewritable CDs and DVDs so that you can reuse them from project to project. Reuse your morning coffee cup.
            Or better yet, buy a mug to avoid the waste caused by throwing away the paper or Styrofoam.
